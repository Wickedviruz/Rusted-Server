===============

**Rusted Server** is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in **Rust**.  
It is inspired by [The Forgotten Server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) and the [OpenTibia Server](https://github.com/opentibia/server) project.  
To connect to the server, you can use [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient).
